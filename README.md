 # **A simple PID implementation in MATLAB/Simulink**

---

It's a linearized Engine Idle Speed Model which is controlled by a PID Controller.

In Sec.1 you can enter the nominal engine speed.

In Sec.2 there are some parameters of a six-cylinder-engine idle speed from an investigation, you are able to change whatever you want! look at [Cook, J. A., and Powell, B. K. Modelling of an internal combustion engine for control analysis. IEEE Control Systems Magazine,,8(4), 1988, 20-26.].

In Sec.3 the state space and transfer function are calculated. look at [Paulinus C. Eze. “Design of a Robust PID Controller for Improved Transient Response Performance of a Linearized Engine Idle Speed Model.” American Journal of Engineering Research (AJER), vol. 6, no. 8, 2017, pp. 305–313.].

In Sec.4 a PID controller is designed.

In Sec.5 it is implemented in a closed-loop system

In Sec.6 Simulation!

In Sec.7 Figure!
